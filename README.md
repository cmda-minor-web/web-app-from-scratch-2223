# Web App From Scratch @cmda-minor-web 2023

In this course I will learn to build a web application without frameworks or unnecessary libraries, but with vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript as much as possible. The end result is a modular, single page web app (SPA). Data will be retrieved from an external API, manipulated and finally shown in the UI of the App. You will learn to apply interface principles when building and testing the interface. With the gained knowledge you will be able to build interactive prototypes, based on a user story and real data. Also you will gain a better understanding of how API's, frameworks and libraries work.

<!-- Add a link to your live demo in Github Pages üåê-->
### - Weblink üîó - If you feel the need to look what I've been doing,
#### - https://safouanem.github.io/web-app-from-scratch-2223/spa/public/final/webapp.html

- I tried to make an u.gg/op.gg clone for myself, and to my surprise I was able to finish more than I expected in the Wiki? I got a bit more in depth about the structure of the code etc.

### Installation
```text
git clone git@github.com:SafouaneM/web-app-from-scratch-2223.git
```
And you should be good to go now, do not forget to implement your own api key in the api.js.
You can request an api key from this url, it'll take no longer then 1 minute to generate one 
#### !(Do note you need a riot games account to generate a key.)!


### Bonus things that I will implement / working on
- [] Autocomplete when you're looking for a summoner
- [~] Champion rotation as the default state
- [] Ranked solo and flex queue last played games and data about said games.
- [] Responsive design ü§™ü§™ü§™
